I was curious one day to see how competent I was in picking up new coding skills, so I decided to take an existing game and see if I could code it from scratch in Unity with as little outside help as possible.
Having no experience with Unity whatsoever, I did need to learn some basics and the method for generating a grid object was lifted in large part from a tutorial, but most of it is just trial and error.
